\subsection{Purpose}
The objective of this Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) is to delineate the foundational framework for the proposed CodeKataBattle platform (CKB). This comprehensive document will thoroughly detail the functional and non-functional requisites of CKB while outlining system's constraints and boundaries. Primarily, this RASD serves as a directive for the development team tasked with implementing the specified requirements. Simultaneously, it acts as a contractual foundation for stakeholders and end-users, ensuring clarity and alignment between expectations and system capabilities. As such, precision in terminology is important, with explicit definitions provided to enhance mutual understanding. \\
The CKB platform introduces a revolutionary approach to enhancing students' software development proficiency through collaborative training in code kata exercises. Oriented towards creating a competitive yet supportive learning environment. Educators are enabled to construct engaging challenges for students from the platform. These challenges involve teams of students competing to demonstrate and refine their coding skills.

\subsubsection{Goals}
Here are the goals to achieve by implementing the CodeKataBattle (CKB) software:

\end{table}

\subsection{Scope}
In the fast-evolving landscape of today's technological era, the demand for adept software developers continues to rise. As the significance of collaborative learning and practical skill development becomes increasingly apparent, educational platforms are crucial in shaping the next generation of software engineers. \\
CodeKataBattle (CKB) emerges as an innovative solution, providing a dynamic platform to practice their software development skills collaboratively. In a society where real-world coding challenges and industry-relevant practices are fundamental, CKB bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. CKB not only proves instrumental in individual skill enhancement but also promotes a sense of healthy competition. This platform aligns with the contemporary need for hands-on, team-oriented learning experiences.
\\ CKB serves as a vital tool in preparing students for the challenges of today's technology-driven society, where adaptability and collaborative problem-solving are key components of success.
\subsubsection{Description of the system}
CKB is a project aimed to help people to learn how to code but also to improve their software development skills, offering a dynamic and interactive environment for users to engage in collaborative learning. It supports two types of users:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Students
  \item Educators
\end{itemize}
The platform facilitates the creation and management of code kata battles, where students can compete against each other to solve programming exercises in lots of different languages of choice, 
either by themselves or joining a team.  \\
Educators, creating code kata battles, challenge teams of students to compete against each other with diverse coding scenarios, allowing students of proving and improving not just their coding abilities but also their collaboration abilities by working in teams. \\
Each battle follows a structured timeline from registration to final submission, with GitHub integration for code versioning and automated assessment.
The system also provides a test-first approach and automated evaluation of functional aspects, timeliness, and source code quality. \\
The platform extends beyond individual battles: educators can also create tournaments, where different educators can add their challenges. Students can subscribe to tournaments and solve the contained battles. The platform will then provide for each tournament a rank that reflects students' cumulative performance. \\
The scope includes features for educators to create, configure, and close tournaments, and for students to visualize tournament's rank. \\
In addition, the system introduces badges that allow educators to define and award achievements based on specific criteria and students to improve their competitiveness, since gained badges are visible to all students and educators. \\
